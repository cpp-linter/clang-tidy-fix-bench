/// augusta::renderer draws through NVIDIA's NVRHI on Vulkan (ADR-0059), used
/// exclusively by the client. It also owns the client's single OS
/// window, a GLFW one: there is no separate augusta::window module
/// (ADR-0059). The window/device-event vocabulary (Key, KeyEvent, EventSink,
/// ...) lives in augusta::input instead, even though Renderer is the one
/// that pushes those events - see input.h's header comment for why the
/// dependency has to run this direction and not the other.
///
/// PumpEvents and RenderFrame are deliberately two separate calls, not one
/// opaque loop, because this engine's threads don't share a cadence
/// (ARCHITECTURE.md §8, ADR-0005): PredictionWorld ticks on the Prediction
/// thread at a fixed rate decoupled from how often a frame is actually
/// presented on the Main/Render thread. PumpEvents just drains the
/// OS's event queue (cheap, safe to call often, e.g. once per
/// Prediction tick's worth of wall time even though it runs on the
/// Main/Render thread); RenderFrame does the actual GPU work and should be
/// called at the app's presentation rate instead. ClientRuntime's Run()
/// loop decides that split; this module just exposes the two primitives.
///
/// Interface scope: draws one static Scene (a list of world-space triangle
/// meshes seen from one camera), plus, per frame, however many RemotePlayer
/// instances PresentationWorld's Interpolation phase produces positions for
/// (SetRemotePlayers, below), each drawn with the mesh of its character
/// (SetCharacterMesh), the fight - tracers, impacts and muzzle flashes
/// (SetCombatEffects) - and the crosshair and hit marker over the frame
/// (SetOverlay): the Presentation State it consumes (ADR-0024), drawn with
/// Slang shaders (ADR-0014). Not drawn yet: the local player's own body and
/// weapon model, and skeletal animation.
